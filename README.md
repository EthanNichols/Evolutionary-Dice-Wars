# IGMimagineCup

Evolutionary Dice Wars, was the final name for this project after completing the 36 hour RIT Imagine Cup.
These are all of the files that were used for the project, and most of them are uncommented, becuase of time constraints.
One day I hope to come back and comment all of this code, before I forget what I was doing and don't understand why I did things.

This is a completed project, so if you're interested in the using the code, please don't hesitate.
Please don't hesitate if you would like to write this in another language, since the executable doesn't work.

The only thing I would like to ask if you use this code, or idea is that you give credit to the Game Dev.
